# Chundoong
Chundoong - Object Relational Mapping Tool (JAVA Project) <br/>

When we need to read datas from many tables, we should send many SQLs to DBMS and can get results. <br/>
JDBC comunicates to DBMS per each SQL.  <br/>
Due to DBMS call is RFC(Remote Function Call), it is expencive in terms of performance.  <br/>
Chundoong invited some procesures to process many requests at one time. <br/>
So, we can get datas from many tables by one DBMS call. <br/>

You can also make your own OR Mapping tool with Chundoong easily. <br/>

You might need to add some open source libraries to build path. <br/>
