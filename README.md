# Chundoong
Chundoong - Object Relational Mapping Tool (JAVA Project)

When we need to read datas from many tables, we should send many SQLs to DBMS and can get results.
JDBC comunicates to DBMS per each SQL. 
Due to DBMS call is RFC(Remote Function Call), it is expencive in terms of performance. 
Chundoong invited some procesures to process many requests at one time.
So, we can get datas from many tables by one DBMS call.

You can make your own OR Mapping tool with Chundoong easily.
